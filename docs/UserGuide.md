## 1. Introduction

Our Project, Kitchen Helper is a kitchen application that is designed to facilitate users to track their kitchen inventory effectively. Kitchen Helper enables users to create recipes with different ingredients and allows auto deduction when you cook using the recipe. Kitchen Helper provides prompts when your ingredient are expiring or its quantity is running low. It also prompts for chores that should be completed by a deadline. Additionally, KitchenHelper helps users track expenditure.      

Kitchen Helper is optimised for those who prefer working with Command Line Interface (CLI). It increases the level of convenience in our busy lives, so give this application a chance to help you!
 
This user guide aims to help you learn your way around our application, making the learning process smooth and effortless. 
So what are you waiting for? Let’s go!

## 2. Quick Start

1. Ensure that you have Java `11` or above installed on your computer.
2. Download the latest version of `KitchenHelper` from [here](https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2113T-M16-2/tp/releases).
3. Save the file as `kitchenhelper.jar` and copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for KitchenHelper.
4. Type the command `java -jar kitchenhelper.jar` in the command prompt to start the application.
5. Type the command in the command box and press `Enter` to execute it.  
   e.g. typing `help` and pressing `Enter` will display help information.
6. Some example commands you can try:  
   * `help` : lists all commands 
   * `addingredient /n Beef cubes /c meat /q 3 /p 20 /e 18/03/2020` : adds an ingredient to the list.
   * `listingredient meat` : list the ingredients that has the category `meat`.
   * `exit` : exits the application.
7. Refer to [Section 3, "Features"](#3-features) for details of each command.

## 3. Features 

Command Format: 
- Words that are enclosed by angle brackets are the parameters to be supplied by the user. E.g. `deleterecipe /n <RECIPE_NAME>` 
From this example, `RECIPE_NAME` will be inputted by the user.
- Items in square brackets with the word [] are optional. E.g. `deleteingredient /n <INGREDIENT_NAME> [/q QUANTITY]` can be used as `deleteingredient /n apple or deleteingredient /n name /q 2`

[&#8593; Return to Top](#kitchen-helper---user-guide)

### 3.2. Storage

#### 3.2.1. Select Load Files (Zi Hui)

At the start of Kitchen Helper, the user will be prompted with the option to either load the program data normally or from the most recent backup storage files.

The normal mode will load Kitchen Helper from the main storage files which store the data from the last used session of the user.

Alternatively, if the user selects the restore mode, it will load Kitchen Helper from the backup storage files which store the version of data manually saved from the user’s last usage of the save command [Section 3.2.2, "Save Current State"](#322-save-current-state-save-zi-hui). The restore mode gives users access to the backup storage files, however, users will have to use the save command to update the backup storage files.

It is important to note that any subsequent changes made to the program data during the current session will be automatically saved into the main storage files regardless of initial load options. 

Example |  Outcome
--------|------------------
**Command**: <br> `1` <br><br> **Description**: <br> Data loaded from the most recent main storage files.  | Please enter '1' to load data from normal mode or '2' to load data from restore mode: <br> 1 <br> =================================================== <br> Okay data have been loaded from the main storage files. <br> ===================================================
**Command**: <br> `2` <br><br> **Description**: <br> Data loaded from the most recent backup storage files.  | Please enter '1' to load data from normal mode or '2' to load data from restore mode: <br> 2 <br> =================================================== <br> Okay data have been loaded from the backup storage files. <br> ===================================================

[&#8593; Return to Top](#kitchen-helper---user-guide)

#### 3.2.2. Save Current State: `save` (Zi Hui)
At any point of the session, if the user wishes to store a backup copy of the current state of their program data, it is recommended that the user uses the save command. The save command will store all program data of the current state into the backup storage files.

__Format:__ `save`  

Example |  Outcome
--------|------------------
**Command**: <br> `save` <br><br> **Description**: <br> Data saved into backup storage files.  | <br> You have saved the current state in the following files: outputIngredientCopy.txt, outputRecipeCopy.txt, outputChoreCopy.txt  <br> =================================================== 

[&#8593; Return to Top](#kitchen-helper---user-guide)

### 3.3. Ingredient
#### 3.3.1. Adding an ingredient: `addingredient` (Jin Fa)
You can add an ingredient to the Kitchen Helper for tracking, containing various details.

__Format:__ `addingredient /n <INGREDIENT_NAME> /c <CATEGORY> /q <QUANTITY> /p <PRICE> /e <EXPIRY>`  

* `INGREDIENT_NAME` is the name of your ingredient.
  + `INGREDIENT NAME` can only consists of **alphabet letters** only.
* `CATEGORY` is the category of your ingredient.  
The different types of `CATEGORY` are listed below: 
  + `Meat`
  + `Vegetable`
  + `Staple`
  + `Fruit`
  + `Dairy`
  + `Drink`
  + `Miscellaneous`  
  
Any `CATEGORY` that **does not falls in the list** would be put under `Miscellaneous`.
* `QUANTITY` is the number of servings of the ingredient.
  + `QUANTITY` in the format of **whole number**.
* `PRICE` is the **unit cost** of a single quantity for ingredient.
  + `PRICE` can be given up to **2 decimal places**.
* `EXPIRY` is the expiry date of the ingredient.
  + `EXPIRY` in the format of **dd/MM/yyyy** e.g. 01/12/2020.
  + **Note**: System will automatically flag ingredient as expired if expiry date is same as the current date. 
  
__Notable Behavior__:
+ If you add an ingredient with the same name (case-insensitive), same price and same expiry data, Kitchen Helper will increase the quantity from the existing data.
+ The expiry date used in `addingredient` given in the `User Guide` may be outdated.   
Please ensure that you input a valid date of the ingredient that is not expired. Otherwise, you may encounter problem adding ingredient to `Kitchen Helper`.
