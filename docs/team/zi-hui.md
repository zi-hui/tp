#### Overview 
Kitchen Helper is a Command Line Application with the main purpose of keeping track of kitchen inventory and related chores. This application allows the user to manage their kitchen inventory through addition, deletion, viewing and calculating expenditures of ingredients. It also prompts the user by notifications to remind them of expiring or/and low quantities ingredients. The user can then make use of the chore task list feature to remind and keep track of upcoming tasks to perform.
